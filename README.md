# Retargetly

Retargetly is a tracking library for iOS

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

After a git clone, open 'Retargetly.xcodeproj' file to explore the project.

The main focus of the library is to track events, separately in three event-types:

```
open - For Library Initialization
change - For front view changed
custom - For developer's choice
```

### Prerequisites

```
Cocoapods
Xcode - Swift 3
```

### Installing

In order to use the library, it must be included in the project via cocoapods, then install pods. You can install cocoapods by this way:

```
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Then, specify 'Retargerlty' pod in podfile:

```
pod 'Retargetly'
```

And finally, install the pods into project:

```
pod install
```


## Usage

After installing, you my do some changes in the project that has Retargetly, the first thing is initialize the library, like so:

The recommended place to initialize the library is 'AppDelegate'

```Swift
import Retargetly
...

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> {

    ...
    RManager.initiate(with: an_ios_hash, pid: an_pid, sid: an_sid)
    ...

return true
}
```

The library will automatically track the 'open' event every time it initializes. In order track an 'change' event, you need to inherit from the class that tracks that event

```Swift
import Retargetly
...

class MyViewController: RViewController {
    ...
}
```

RViewController automatically tracks the 'change' event with its 'viewDidAppear' method.

Finally, in order to track an 'custom' event, you need to do so:

```Swift
import Retargetly
...

func anAction {

    ...
    RManager.track(value: aValue) {(error) in
        print(error)
    }
    ...

}
```

The 'custom' event, allows you to have an complation callback, and it might have an 'error' object if it ocurred.
